# Ian-Burley-Portfolio
 
## Description
Technology used
1. html
2. css

## Purpose
Baseline for my future portfolio.

## Challenges 
Created framework to resemble physical portfolio. The intention is to enahnce the overall look and feel over time as more projects are added and additional skills are gained to make the page more visually appealing. May move to a format that creates Portfolio 1 and 2 as clickable tabs at the top of a single "manilla folder frame" as I gain the JS skills to create this effect. If I'm being honest, I ran with this idea and created the entire thing without realizing theres was a visual demo until I went to submit. If this is too far from said demo I am happy to resubmit as there's no such thing as too much practice.
